## Tricks

### 7.1 Query Log / Query Count (Tip #1)

Once you are done writing the code for your page,

1. Add this before the line, from where you wanna start logging queries (generally first line of the function)

   ```php
   DB::connection()->enableQueryLog();
   ```

2. Add this after the line, after which you wanna count the total number of queries (generally before returning the view/response)

   ```php
   $queries = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB::getQueryLog();
   dd($queries->count(), $queries);
   ```

3. Use the following to perform to debug the same in a view

   ```blade
   @php
     $queries = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB::getQueryLog();
   @endphp

   @if(count($queries) > 1)
     @php
       dd($queries);
     @endphp
   @endif
   ```
