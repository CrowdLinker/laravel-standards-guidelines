# 6. Helpers

Helpers are functions that are used for handling a common operation throughout an application. For eg, sorting of an array alphabetically, flattening of an array, creating a string with first letter capital of each word and more. These functions come in really handy through out the application and can help remove redundancy in the code.

**Note:** You must avoid creating helper functions for methods like _transforming request inputs_ since they belong to a service only. If however, the transformation of inputs is common for all services, consider creating a common or base service class and extend it to the services requiring this method.

## 6.1 Defining

### 6.1.1 Autoload Using Composer

1. In `composer.json`, add this to **autoload** key.
   ```json
   "autoload": {
       "files": [
           "app/Helpers/Helper.php"
       ]
   },
   ```
2. In `app/Helpers`, create a file called `Helper.php` and add this

   ```php
   <?php

   require 'FileName.php';
   ```

   Try creating files based on the entity the functions might be based on. For eg. **Storage.php** for file storage related functions

3. Now in any of the file, create php functions using the **snake_case** naming convention.
   ```php
   /**
    * Upload Files To A Directory
    *
    * @param array   $files
    * @param int     $id
    * @param string  $path
    * @param string  $model
    *
    * @return array
    */
   function upload_files(array $files, $id, $path = '', $model = 'user')
   {
       // ....
   }
   ```
